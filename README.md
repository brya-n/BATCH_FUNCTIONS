# BATCH_FUNCTIONS
Microsoft Windows 7, 10
Intended to return formatted string of:
CODE#VALUE#NUL
As ECHO
So this can be delimited by the calling batch program

CODE:  0 = success,  1 = not found,  2 = insufficient arguments supplied
VALUE: Result of function
NUL:   Because I'm fed up of sometimes extra spaces at end of a return, defensive programming!
